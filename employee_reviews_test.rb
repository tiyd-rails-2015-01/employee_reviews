    "Thus far, there have been two concerns over Yvonne's performance, and both have been discussed with her in internal meetings.  First, in some cases, Yvonne takes longer to complete tasks than would normally be expected.  This most commonly manifests during development on existing applications, but can sometimes occur during development on new projects, often during tasks shared with Andrew.  In order to accommodate for these preferences, Yvonne has been putting more time into fewer projects, which has gone well.

    Second, while in conversation, Yvonne has a tendency to interrupt, talk over others, and increase her volume when in disagreement.  In client meetings, she also can dwell on potential issues even if the client or other attendees have clearly ruled the issue out, and can sometimes get off topic."
